<h1>Design Manifesto</h1>
<p>After completing this course and looking back at the original good communication design manifesto I wrote, my three core attributes have changed. <br /><br />
<b>Understanding your audience:</b> <br />
I originally wrote on how user-friendliness was essential to good communication design but having a true understanding of who you are designing for covers all aspects of user interaction. My card binder application started out as a website with extra layouts I thought looked good with a bland color scheme. After understanding what I was designing and who I was designing for through articles and feedback with the class I completely changed the design into an application that looks and functions better. I changed the website into an application for the phone due to the audience using the app at card tournaments. The new central function of the app was to give the community a way to trade cards without going to a card shop and having to find the cards you need through someone’s binder. By understanding how the community trades and the inefficiencies of the trade methods, I was able to understand how to design a trade function that gives value to the community. I also decided to use dark colors because the MTG cards have dark themes, which the audience would like because it keeps the continuity of what the game is about.<br /><br />
<b>Divide design by necessity:</b><br />
I wrote about good communication design being easy to recall and responsive, but these are aspects that may or may not be necessary depending on their value of the design. I believe dividing the components of a design by what’s necessary is a good communication design method because you can understand how each factor is valued. With the card binder application I completed, I divided the components needed for the design. The components of the design were: the user-interface and the logic. Through this class I was able to understand this method through the steps taken in designing the different projects. Both factors had their necessary value, but knowing what aspects went where gives you a better understanding in how to best communicate your design. <br /><br />
<b>Conclusion:</b><br />In conclusion, I changed my original 3 factors of good communication design into broader understandings because they don’t cover all the good ways to communicate a design’s value. These concepts were drawn from the different the articles and experiences in the class. I believe there are more understandings of good communication design, but we all have a different way in comprehending the value of them.
