<p>Good Communication Design I believe can be narrowed down to three core attributes: BEING USER-FRIENDLY, EASY TO RECALL and MEASURED RESPONSIVENESS. Obviously, each attribute falls into a spectrum on how much is needed for good communication design<hr /></p>
<p>For instance, an application which their target audience are senior citizens would capture the most value through a communication design that is high on the spectrum of USER-FRIENDLINESS. How? Using a basic design that reacts in with easy and smooth transitions when interacting with will help senior citizens not feel too overwhelmed by it. Why? Well it’s safe to say that senior citizens may not be as tech savvy as generation Z because they didn’t grow up with a personal computer in their home or have used some sort of portable device to store information since elementary. In contrast, an application made for a boisterous bunch like middle school teenagers, good communication design for their demographic should be USER-FRIENDLINESS made for them. Furthermore, a good communication design with USER FRIENDLINESS for an application mentioned previously for the teenagers should have interactions they can identify easily and should make using the application like second nature. Because of these different circumstances, it’s ESSENTIAL that good USER-FRIENDLY design be measured appropriately on the spectrum.<hr /></p>
<p>It’s EASY TO RECALL the different communication designs we enjoy interacting with, but how is it on the other end? How does one make a design that is EASY TO RECALL? Why does one make a design that is EASY TO RECALL? Well, designers should design EASY TO RECALL interactions because it’s like leaving a watermark of your brand instilled in a person’s brain. Good designs that are EASY TO RECALL should have purpose. Depending on the spectrum a design is made on, the purpose of the design should be memorable like an interactive sound or visual when a user is clicks on a tab. When an application is mentioned through either verbal or non-verbal communication, a user of the application should be able to remember the interactive design because it was EASY TO RECALL.<hr /></p>
<p>Depending on the purpose of a design, a spectrum exists of how much RESPONSIVENESS is needed by MEASURING the different. When I say RESPONSIVE, I mean that good communication design should involve RESPONSIVE concepts throughout the user’s entire usage. When a user on an application like a game wants to be in that game mindsight, good design should have several RESPONSIVE characteristics like moving objects when hovering over menus or visual changes when interacting with the entire game user interface.<hr /></p>
<p>This sums up what good design should include. Every designer should consider the spectrums of USER-FRIENDLINESS needed while communicating EASY TO RECALL designs throughout the user’s experience and use MEASURED RESPONSIVENESS based on the level needed for different users.<hr /></p>
